* Casual Agenda
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based user interface for [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html][Org Agenda]], a feature of Emacs [[https://orgmode.org/features.html][Org mode]] to help plan your day.

[[file:docs/images/casual-agenda-screenshot.png]]

* Motivation
While highly functional, Org Agenda has a steep learning curve as it has a very diverse command set. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offer users discoverability and recall that can lower Org Agenda's learning curve. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient in Emacs core allows for a menu UI that is keyboard-driven. Casual Agenda endeavors to offer this as many Emacs users prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI for Org Agenda.
- To provide casual access to the Org Agenda command set.

** Non-Goals
- Full coverage of all Org Agenda commands. Casual Agenda is not intended to be a power user tool.
- Strict adherence to Org Agenda command naming. While Casual Agenda is *mostly* in alignment with Org Agenda’s command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual Agenda is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

* Requirements
Casual Agenda requires usage of
- Emacs ≥ 29.1 
- Org ≥ 9.7.1

Casual Agenda has been verified with the following configuration. 
- Emacs 29.4 (macOS 14.6, Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4 LTS)
- Org 9.7.9

* Asks
As Casual Agenda is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-agenda/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual Agenda's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Install
If installed via MELPA then add these lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference. 
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-agenda) ; optional
  (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-agenda-tmenu)
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, here is the recipe for installing it.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-agenda
    :ensure nil
    :bind (:map
           org-agenda-mode-map
           ("C-o" . casual-agenda-tmenu)))
#+end_src


** Configuration
Use these bindings to configure Org Agenda to be consistent with bindings used by Casual Agenda. This is optional.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  ; bindings to make jumping consistent between Org Agenda and Casual Agenda
  (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "M-j" #'org-agenda-clock-goto) ; optional
  (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "J" #'bookmark-jump) ; optional
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, modify your configuration as follows:
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-agenda
    :ensure nil
    :bind (:map
           org-agenda-mode-map
           ("C-o" . casual-agenda-tmenu)
           ("M-j" . org-agenda-clock-goto) ; optional
           ("J" . bookmark-jump))) ; optional
#+end_src

* Usage

The main menu is divided into five sections:

- *Agenda* - Modify the view duration (day, week, year)
- *Filter* - Filter displayed headlines with different criteria
- *Actions* - Perform an activity on a headline, create/capture a headline or even generate a different agenda view.
- *Navigation* - move the point to where you want it to be.
- *Utils* - Set a timer, get almanac info.

** Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “(u) Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Agenda will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.

* Common Menu Actions
Casual Agenda is built using Transient menus and as such adopts much of its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key. 

Dismissing a menu regardless of how deep you are in sub-menus can be done by entering ~C-q~. A menu can also be dismissed by entering ~C-g~, which will return you to the previous menu.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

Menu items can also take a prefix argument if supported. Enter ~C-u~ and optionally a value before selecting a menu item.
